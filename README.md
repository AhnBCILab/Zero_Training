# Zero_Training with signal alignment 
Acquiring data for training a model is a crucial step for achieving a high-performance Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). To reduce or remove this time-consuming phase, re-using the previously acquired data is suggested [1]. However. problems may still exist due to different UX of applications, devices or control paradigms. In this study, we propose an approach to minimize signal differences caused by different system environments, which possibly benefits for better BCI performance. Particularly, we focus on P300 BCI but with different environment (PC based P300 speller [1] and VR based Drone control application [2]).
